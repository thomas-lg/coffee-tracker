.SYNOPSIS
    Regenerates the backend packages.lock.json files after a NuGet version change.

.DESCRIPTION
    backend/Directory.Build.props sets RestorePackagesWithLockFile, and CI restores
    with --locked-mode (see .github/workflows/ci.yml) so a dependency bump cannot land
    without a reviewed lock file. NuGet writes one lock file per project, so bumping a
    package in Application or Infrastructure also invalidates the lock files of Api and
    Tests, which reference them transitively. Dependabot only refreshes the lock file of
    the project whose .csproj it edited, so its PRs fail with:

        error NU1004: The project references coffeetracker.infrastructure whose
        dependencies has changed. The packages lock file is inconsistent with the
        project dependencies so restore can't be run in locked mode.

    This script is the fix: a solution-wide `dotnet restore --force-evaluate`, which
    re-resolves every graph and rewrites every lock file. It runs natively when a .NET
    SDK is on PATH, and otherwise inside the same SDK container image the Dockerfile
    uses, so it works on a host with no SDK installed as well as in the dev container.

    It refuses to leave behind changes to anything other than the lock files: a modified
    .csproj would mean the restore resolved something the version bump did not intend.

.PARAMETER Check
    Verify only. Runs the CI restore (--locked-mode) and fails if the lock files are
    inconsistent, without rewriting anything.

.EXAMPLE
    ./scripts/refresh-lockfiles.ps1
    Refresh the lock files, then `git add backend/*/packages.lock.json` and commit.

.EXAMPLE
    ./scripts/refresh-lockfiles.ps1 -Check
    Reproduce the CI restore locally to confirm the committed lock files are consistent.
