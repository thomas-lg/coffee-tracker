# Production image: build the Angular app, publish the API, and serve the SPA
# same-origin from the API on :8080. Built for linux/amd64 and linux/arm64.

# --- Stage 1: build the Angular PWA ---
# Pinned to the BUILD platform, not the target: this stage emits static files, which have
# no architecture. Letting it follow the target would run the whole Angular build under
# QEMU for an arm64 image, for bytes that would come out identical.
# node:24-slim -- keep in step with ci.yml's node-version and the devcontainer's node
# feature. 24 is the current LTS. Majors are pinned deliberately, not by parity: the gate
# is frontend/package.json's engines (^20.19 || ^22.12 || ^24, i.e. Angular's supported
# range) plus LTS status -- an even major is still "Current" until the October of its
# release year. Dependabot ignores node majors here; move all three references at once.

# no package.json and is copied with the sources below.

# Also pinned to the BUILD platform. The publish is portable, no -r/-a, so the output is
# architecture-neutral IL plus a runtimes/ folder carrying every native asset, and the
# entrypoint starts it through the `dotnet` muxer rather than the apphost. The runtime
# stage below is what makes the image arm64 or amd64.
#
# Cross-compiling instead (-a $TARGETARCH) is not an option here: a RID-specific restore
# fails --locked-mode with NU1004, because the committed lock files carry no runtime
# identifiers. Emulating this stage would cost minutes per build for no difference in
# output.

# Two OCR engines, both driven by shelling out and piping the image over stdin.
#
# RapidOCR (PP-OCR on onnxruntime) is the default, and it is what costs the size here:
# the image goes from 351 MB to 784 MB on disk (145 MB to 302 MB compressed, which is
# what a pull actually costs), all of it Python, numpy and onnxruntime. It buys reading a photograph rather
# than a scanned page. On the benchmark's real bags Tesseract returns "lam" where the
# label says "LA LIBERTAD" and nothing at all for "INTENSO BLEND"; RapidOCR reads both.
# The package is `rapidocr`, not `rapidocr-onnxruntime`: the latter is the same
# project's earlier name, frozen since January 2025 on PP-OCRv4, while `rapidocr` ships
# PP-OCRv6 and reads these bags visibly better (TORREFACTEUR at 99.7% against a mangled
# "TORREFACTEY,"). It depends on opencv-python, whose GUI build carries ~116 MB of X11
# libraries to draw windows a server will never open, so it is swapped for the headless
# build afterwards. Installing headless alongside does not help: pip honours the
# dependency and ships both.
#
# Tesseract stays installed and one setting away (Ocr:Engine=tesseract), because it is a
# tenth of the size and a fair answer for anyone who would rather not carry the rest.
# gosu drops privileges in the entrypoint; curl is only for the HEALTHCHECK (the aspnet
# image ships neither curl nor wget). TESSDATA_PREFIX is the parent of the tessdata dir.
